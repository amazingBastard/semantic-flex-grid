#Semanitc Flex Grid

Many of the standard grids are very bloated with unnecessary features and the class names are often confusing when all you really need is a grid that is simple and clean.

Looking into a couple of grid systems, I've come to like semantic-ui's approach to naming conventions, however, their grid system was still hacky like bootstrap. This is when a friend of mine showed me [Solved by Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) and I was immediately impressed and relieved that I found the grid I was searching for.

Please note, this grid only works in modern browsers, refer to [Phillip Walton's page](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/) for more info. This is an iteration over his solution, I just changed the naming conventions used for the grid, added some extra responsive classes for phones, tablets, desktop and ported it over to LESS. Enjoy, explore, and feel free to contribute.
